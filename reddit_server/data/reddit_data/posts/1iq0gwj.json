  "selftext": "DS teams are starting to lose the essence that made them truly groundbreaking. their mixed scientific and business core. What we’re seeing now is a shift from deep statistical analysis and business oriented modeling to quick and dirty engineering solutions. Sure, this approach might give us a few immediate wins but it leads to low ROI projects and pulls the field further away from its true potential. One size-fits-all programming just doesn’t work. it’s not the whole game.\n",
