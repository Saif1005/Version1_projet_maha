  "selftext": "Every below average cs grad I know that couldn’t find a job post grad is going to grad school for data science. Every person I know in different career fields where they don’t get paid much is also getting a masters in data science. I feel like the number of cs students I hear about has dropped a bit since the tech layoffs and I definitely hear more data science students now. Am I just biased or has anyone else noticed it? Like data science is the new SWE? ",
