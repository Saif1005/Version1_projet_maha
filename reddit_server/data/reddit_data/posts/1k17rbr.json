  "selftext": "A lot of people (like me) dive  into ML thinking it's about understanding intelligence, learning, or even just clever math — and then they wake up buried under a pile of frameworks, configs, random seeds, hyperparameter grids, and Google Colab crashes. And the worst part? No one tells you how undefined the field really is until you're *knee-deep in the swamp.*\n\nIn mathematics:\n\n* There's structure. Rigor. A kind of calm beauty in clarity.\n* You can prove something and *know* it’s true.\n* You explore the unknown, yes — but on solid ground.\n\nIn ML:\n\n* You fumble through a foggy mess of tunable knobs and lucky guesses.\n* “Reproducibility” is a fantasy.\n* Half the field is just “what worked better for us” and the other half is trying to explain it *after* the fact.\n* Nobody *really* knows why half of it works, and yet they act like they do.",
