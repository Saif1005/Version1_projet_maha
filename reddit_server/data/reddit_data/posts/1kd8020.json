  "selftext": "I am an electrical engineering master’s student with 2 research positions in machine learning, my focus is in communication systems and DSP. I always thought my background and academic history were above average compared to my peers as an undergrad and in graduate school. I’m about to finish my degree program so I’ve been applying to jobs. Applied to around 40-50 jobs and have only gotten 3 interviews which led to nothing. I am having second doubts on if I should change my focus and deviate from being an AI engineer. Just wanted to get some insight from those who are in industry or government on how much demand there is for ML engineers.",
