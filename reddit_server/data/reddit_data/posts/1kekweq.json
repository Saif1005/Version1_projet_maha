  "selftext": "I will be pursuing my degree in Applied statistics and data science(well my university will be offering both statistical knowledge and data science).I have talked with many people but they got mixed reactions with this. I still don't know whether to go for applied stat and data science or go for software engineering.Though I also know that software engineering can be learned by myself as I am also a competitive programmer who attended national informatics olympiad. So I got a programming background but I also am thinking to add some extra skills. will this be worth it for me to go for data science?",
