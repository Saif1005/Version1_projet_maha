  "selftext": "For context, I love math and I'm good at it. I'm thinking this might be a good option to pursue in college, but I'm not entirely sure what it entails and what jobs would be available in the future. I'm not too terribly concerned about how much money I make, but I certainly don't want to be stuck in a position where my major does nothing except get in the way of paying the bills. Can anyone who was formerly or is currently pursuing a data science major give your opinion on the degree? Anything would be appreciated!\n\nEdit: thought I should mention that I also considered Econ or something similar; not sure about that either. Googling doesn't seem to help as much as people say it does, you just get the same watered down info over and over again. I'm getting tired of reading the same articles and receiving zero guidance. Are there any other degrees similar to these two that I may be overlooking?",
