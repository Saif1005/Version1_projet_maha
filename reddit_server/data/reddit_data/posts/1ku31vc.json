  "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m currently studying data science, but I’ve been hearing that the demand for data scientists is decreasing significantly. I’ve also been told that many data scientists are essentially becoming analysts, while the machine learning side of things is increasingly being handled by engineers.\n\n- Does it still make sense to pursue a career in data science or should i switch to computer science? I mean i dont think i want to do just AB tests for a living\n\n- Also, are machine learning engineers still building models or are they mostly focused on deploying them?\n",
