  "selftext": "\nI am currently studying Data Science and really fell in love with the field, but the more i progress the more depressed i become.\n\nOver the past year, after watching job postings especially in tech I’ve realized most Data Scientist roles are basically advanced data analysts, focused on dashboards, metrics, A/B tests. (It is not a bad job dont get me wrong, but it is not the direction i want to take)\n\nThe actual ML work seems to be done by ML Engineers, which often requires deep software engineering skills which something I’m not passionate about.\n\nRight now, I feel stuck. I don’t think I’d enjoy spending most of my time on product analytics, but I also don’t see many roles focused on ML unless you’re already a software engineer (not talking about research but training models to solve business problems).\n\nDo you have any advice?                                      \n\n**Also will there ever be more space for Data Scientists to work hands on with ML or is that firmly in the engineer’s domain now? I mean which is your idea about the field?**",
