  "selftext": "**Autocorrelation & The Random Walk explained** with a drunk man 🍺\n\nLet me illustrate this statistical concept with an example we can all visualize.\n\nImagine a drunk man wandering a city. His steps are completely random and unpredictable.\n\n**Here's the intuition**:\n\n\\- His current position is completely tied to his previous position\n\n\\- We know where he is RIGHT NOW, but have no idea where he'll be in the next minute\n\n**The statistical insight**:\n\nIn a random walk, the *current position* is highly correlated with the *previous position*, but the *changes in position* (the steps) are completely random & uncorrelated.\n\n\n\nThis is why random walks are so tricky to forecast!\n\n[Part 2: Time Series Forecasting: Build a Baseline & Understand the Random Walk](https://youtu.be/_Ke54TJqY9s) \n\n  \nWould love to hear your **thoughts, feedback** about this topic",
