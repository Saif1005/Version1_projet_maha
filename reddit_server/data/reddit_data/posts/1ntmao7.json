  "selftext": "I’m doing a college project that wants me to use Mobaxterm for my terminal and WinSCP to transfer files and I’m using a college provided Linux server. In mobaxterm I use a code editor called nedit. \n\nI’ve used VSC on a project before and it was so much easier , and everything was built in one. I told the professor and he said well you could but I think this is better. \n\nI’m confused how this slow multi step process can be better than VSC?\n\n(This is a bioinformatics project using biopython)",
