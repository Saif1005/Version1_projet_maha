  "selftext": "**What My Project Does**\n\ni am building an Logly a  **logging library for Python** that combines simplicity with **high performance** using a Rust backend. It supports:\n\n* Console and file logging\n* JSON / structured logging\n* Async background writing to reduce latency\n* Pretty formatting with minimal boilerplate\n\nIt’s designed to be **lightweight, fast, and easy to use**, giving Python developers a modern logging solution without the complexity of the built-in `logging` module.\n\n**Latency Microbenchmark (30,000 messages):**\n\n|Percentile|`logging`Python|Logly|Speedup|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|p50|0.014 ms|0.002 ms|7×|\n|p95|0.029 ms|0.002 ms|14.5×|\n|p99|0.043 ms|0.015 ms|2.9×|\n\n>\n\n\\> **Note:** Performance may vary depending on your OS, CPU, Python version, and system load. Benchmarks show **up to 10× faster performance** under high-volume or multi-threaded workloads, but actual results will differ based on your environment.\n\n**Target Audience**\n\n* Python developers needing high-performance logging\n* Scripts, web apps, or production systems\n* Developers who want structured logging or async log handling without overhead\n\n**Logging Library Comparison**\n\n|Feature / Library|`logging`Python|Loguru|Structlog|**Logly (v0.1.1)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Backend**|Python|Python|Python|Rust|\n|**Async Logging**|❌|✅ (basic)|✅|✅ (high-performance, async background writer)|\n|**File & Console Logging**|✅|✅|✅|✅|\n|**JSON / Structured Logging**|✅ (manual)|✅|✅|✅ (built-in, easy)|\n|**Ease of Use**|Medium|High|Medium|High (simple API, minimal boilerplate)|\n|**Performance (single-threaded)**|Baseline|\\~1.5–2× faster|\\~1×|\\~3.5× faster|\n|**Performance (multi-threaded / concurrent)**|Baseline|\\~2–3×|\\~1×|**up to 10× faster** 🚀|\n|**Pretty Formatting / Color**|❌ / limited|✅|❌|✅|\n|**Rotation / Retention**|✅ (config-heavy)|✅|Limited|✅|\n|**Additional Notes**|Standard library, reliable, but verbose and slower|Easy setup, friendly API|Structured logging focus|Rust backend, optimized for high-volume, async, low-latency logging|\n\n**Example Usage**\n\n    from logly import logger\n    \n    logger.info(\"Hello from Logly!\")\n    logger.debug(\"Logging asynchronously to a file\")\n    logger.error(\"Structured logging works too!\", extra={\"user\": \"alice\"})\n\n**Links**\n\n* GitHub (open source): [https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/logly/](https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/logly/)\n* PyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/logly/](https://pypi.org/project/logly/)\n\n**To Get Started:**\n\n    pip install logly\n\nPlease feel free to **check it out, give feedback, and report any issues** on GitHub or PyPI. I’d really appreciate your thoughts and contributions! 🙂\n\n**Note: This Project is Not Vibe-Coded or AI Used i am Only Have Used AI for Documentation Purposes to Speed up Initial Development Only, the Code itself is Mine and Implemented by Mine (No AI Usage from the start itself) and also the performance of logly is not tested fully yet because this project is still in active development!**\n\n**UPDATE!!! 🚀** (03-10-2025) Thanks for all the feedback, everyone! Based on user requests, I’ve improved **Logly v0.1.4** (Released now) and added some new features. I’ve also updated the documentation for better clarity.\n\n✅ Currently, Logly supports **Linux, Windows, and macOS** for **Python 3.10 to 3.13**. 📖 Please report any issues or errors directly on **GitHub,** that’s the best place for bug reports and feature requests (not Reddit). For broader conversations, please use [**GitHub Discussions**](https://github.com/muhammad-fiaz/logly/discussions).\n\nFor those [asking for proof of my work](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nv3tgp/comment/nhdisrd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button): I’ve been actively coding and tracking my projects via [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/@muhammadfiaz), and I have a good community supporting my work.\n\nI understand some people may not like the project, and that’s fine, you’re free to have your opinion. But if you want to give constructive feedback, please do it openly on GitHub under your real account instead of throwaway or anonymous ones. That way, the feedback is more helpful and transparent.\n\nBTW! I take **docstrings and documentation very seriously :) ,** I personally review every single one each time to ensure quality and clarity. If anything is missing or not updated for the latest release, you can always create an issue or a PR. I always welcome contributions.\n\nAlso, judging whether I used AI just based on [my *constant* bullet points, bold text or docstrings ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nv3tgp/comment/nh9h8ua/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)in the Rust code? That’s really childish,  comments and docstrings alone aren’t proof of anything. I always make sure to add both to keep everything well-documented for contributors, and also saying \"[Rust Devs don't use comments and docstrings](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nv3tgp/comment/nhe8f9v/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\" but I’ve seen plenty of experienced Rust developers use them as well, in Rust and across all programming languages.\n\nFinally 🙂 I am not promoting or making statements about whether using AI is right or wrong, good practice or bad practice, it depends entirely on your use case and personal preference and up to you only.\n\nIf you still insist this is “vibe coding,” then fine, that’s your opinion. If not, then it’s whatever, I don’t care. I am using my **real name** and being transparent. Just because I work on this project personally doesn’t mean it’s for a [job or resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nv3tgp/comment/nh7zjyc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button); I’ve clearly stated that in my profile. If you want to collaborate, feel free to do so for **improvements**, but commenting about [useless things](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nv3tgp/comment/nhdyz6a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) or **misleading claims by** [puppeteer accounts](https://www.reddit.com/user/bay400/) doesn’t help anyone.\n\nI wrote this message for people who are genuinely interested in creating new methods or contributing. [I am not promoting the project simply because it’s in Rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nv3tgp/comment/nhdyp23/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button),I wanted **feedback**, which is why I’m asking for input here for improvement, not for childish debates about whether I used AI or not.\n\nAt the end of the day, we’re all here to learn, whether you have 20+ years of experience in IT or you’re just a newbie. **Constructive discussion and improvements help everyone grow.**\n\nAnd just to be clear I’m doing this to build awesome things in public and grow in public, so people can see the progress, learn, and contribute along the way :)\n\n**Thanks again for all your support! 🙏🙂**",
