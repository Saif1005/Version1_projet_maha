  "selftext": "I recently started working at FAANG as a DS. We have a very chill team and workload is pretty relaxed. The work itself is not the most interesting (basically a cog in the machine type role) but the pay and people are good so I'm staying for now. \n\nHow have you guys used the resources that huge companies have to find interesting work to do when your day to day is limited. I know of some personal projects I could do, but I was more interested in if its possible to somehow leverage my companies resources to make the project more interesting. Has anyone else done something similar, any ideas or motivation would be appreciated.",
