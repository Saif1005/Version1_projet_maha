  "selftext": "Honestly, GLM 4.6 might be my favorite LLM right now. I threw it a messy, real-world coding project, full front-end build, 20+ components, custom data transformations, and a bunch of steps that normally require me to constantly keep track of what’s happening. With older models like GLM 4.5 and even the latest Claude 4.5 Sonnet, I’d be juggling context limits, cleaning up messy outputs, and basically babysitting the process.\n\nGLM 4.6? It handled everything smoothly. Remembered the full context, generated clean code, even suggested little improvements I hadn’t thought of. Multi-step workflows that normally get confusing were just… done. And it did all that using fewer tokens than 4.5, so it’s faster and cheaper too.\n\nLoved the new release [Z.ai](http://Z.ai)",
