  "title": "Fun Interview with Jason Strimpel about transferable skills from data science to algorithmic trading.",
  "selftext": "I had the opportunity to interview Jason Strimpel.  He's been in trading and technology for 25 years as a hedge fund trader, risk quant, machine learning engineering manager, and GenAI specialist at AWS. He is now the Managing Director of AI and Advanced Analytics at a major consulting company. \n\nI asked him all about the transferable skills, the mindset shifts, tools someone should pick up if they're just getting started, how algo trading is similar to ML, and differences in how you think about/work with the data. He had a lot of great tips if you're a data person thinking about getting into trading.",
