  "selftext": "**What My Project Does**  \nI built a small Clue/Cluedo-style deduction game in **Python** using **pygame**. It’s a scene-based desktop game with clean, portable asset handling. You can run it from source or as a single **Windows .exe** (PyInstaller one-file). The repo is meant to be a practical reference for packaging pygame apps reliably.\n\n**Source code (GitHub):**  \n[https://github.com/rozsit/112\\_PyClue\\_Game](https://github.com/rozsit/112_PyClue_Game)\n\n*(Windows build is in the GitHub Release — see “Downloads” below.)*\n\n**Target Audience**\n\n* Python devs interested in **pygame** architecture and **packaging to .exe**.\n* Learners who want a small, readable codebase (scenes, UI, audio, animations).\n* Casual players who just want to double-click an `.exe` and try a Clue-like game.\n\n**Comparison**  \nCompared with other “pygame Clue clones” or small hobby games, this repo focuses on **robust distribution** and **developer ergonomics**:\n\n* Works the same in **dev** and **frozen** modes (PyInstaller).\n* Global hooks route string paths for `pygame.image.load`, `pygame.mixer.Sound`, and `pygame.mixer.music.load` → fewer path bugs after packaging.\n* **Audio init** on Windows is hardened (`ensure_audio()` tries multiple drivers/buffer sizes).\n* **Animated GIF** support via **Pillow** (e.g., winner screen fireworks → frames + per-frame duration).\n* Comes with a one-command **build script** (PowerShell) and a **SHA-256** file for integrity checks.\n\n**How Python Is Used**\n\n* **pygame** for windowing, scenes, input, and rendering.\n* **Pillow** to decode animated GIFs into (surface, duration) frames.\n* **PyInstaller** (one-file) to ship a single `.exe`.\n\n**Minimal snippets (the core ideas):**\n\n    # resource_path: dev + PyInstaller (_MEIPASS) friendly\n    from pathlib import Path\n    import sys\n    def resource_path(*parts):\n        if hasattr(sys, \"_MEIPASS\"):\n            base = Path(sys._MEIPASS)\n        else:\n            here = Path(__file__).resolve()\n            base = next((p for p in [here] + list(here.parents) if (p / \"assets\").exists()), here)\n        return str((base / Path(*parts)).resolve())\n    \n\n    # global hooks so string paths work after packaging, too\n    import pygame\n    _orig_img = pygame.image.load\n    def _img_wrapped(path, *a, **kw):\n        from utils import resource_path\n        if isinstance(path, str): path = resource_path(path)\n        return _orig_img(path, *a, **kw)\n    pygame.image.load = _img_wrapped\n    \n    # similar tiny wrappers exist for pygame.mixer.Sound and pygame.mixer.music.load\n    \n\n**Run from Source**\n\n    git clone https://github.com/rozsit/112_PyClue_Game\n    cd 112_PyClue_Game\n    python -m venv .venv\n    .\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate           # Windows\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    python main.py\n    \n\n**Downloads (Windows .exe)**  \nGrab the one-file build from the Release page:  \n[https://github.com/rozsit/112\\_PyClue\\_Game/releases/tag/v1.0.0](https://github.com/rozsit/112_PyClue_Game/releases/tag/v1.0.0)\n\n**(Optional) Verify SHA-256 on Windows**\n\n    Get-FileHash .\\PyClue.exe -Algorithm SHA256\n    # or\n    certutil -hashfile .\\PyClue.exe SHA256\n    \n\nThe output should match the `PyClue.exe.sha256` provided in the release.\n\n**Roadmap / PRs Welcome**\n\n* New boards, items, rule variants\n* Simple AI opponents\n* Local/online multiplayer\n* Localization (EN/HU)\n* Save/load & stats\n\nI’d love feedback on packaging tricks (PyInstaller + pygame), audio reliability on different Windows setups, and ergonomics of the scene/asset layout.",
