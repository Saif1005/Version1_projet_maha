  "selftext": "Hi guys, I need to do a project using many linear models and I’m looking for a dataset. Ideally something interesting with lots of numerical variables, especially one where kriging could be applied.\n\nIf you have any dataset suggestions or interesting research questions I could build the project around, I’d really appreciate it. Thanks a lot!\n\nPS: i did not like chatgpt suggestions, they were cliche (even if i explicitly asked “not cliche”)",
