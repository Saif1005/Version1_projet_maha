      "selftext": "\nI am currently studying Data Science and really fell in love with the field, but the more i progress the more depressed i become.\n\nOver the past year, after watching job postings especially in tech I’ve realized most Data Scientist roles are basically advanced data analysts, focused on dashboards, metrics, A/B tests.

      "selftext": "I’ve been working in data science for the last ten years, both in industry and academia, having pursued a master’s and PhD in Europe. My experience in the industry, overall, has been very positive. I’ve had the opportunity to work with brilliant people on exciting, high-impact projects. Of course, there were the usual high-stress situations, nonsense PowerPoints, and impossible deadlines, but the work largely felt meaningful.\n\nHowever, over the past two years or so, it feels like the field has taken a sharp turn. Just yesterday, I attended a technical presentation from the analytics team. The project aimed to identify anomalies in a dataset composed of multiple time series, each containing a clear inflection point. The team’s hypothesis was that these trajectories might indicate entities engaged in some sort of fraud.\n\nThe team claimed to have solved the task using “generative AI”. They didn’t go into methodological details but presented results that, according to them, were amazing. Curious, nespecially since the project was heading toward deployment, i asked about validation, performance metrics, or baseline comparisons. None were presented.\n\nLater, I found out that “generative AI” meant asking ChatGPT to generate a code. The code simply computed the mean of each series before and after the inflection point, then calculated the z-score of the difference. No model evaluation. No metrics. No baselines. Absolutely no model criticism. Just a naive approach, packaged and executed very, very quickly under the label of generative AI.\n\nThe moment I understood the proposed solution, my immediate thought was \"I need to get as far away from this company as possible\". I share this anecdote because it summarizes much of what I’ve witnessed in the field over the past two years. It feels like data science is drifting toward a kind of pseudo-science where we consult a black-box oracle for answers, and questioning its outputs is treated as anti-innovation, while no one really understand how the outputs were generated.\n\nAfter several experiences like this, I’m seriously considering focusing on academia. Working on projects like these is eroding any hope I have in the field. I know this won’t work and yet, the label generative AI seems to make it unquestionable. So I came here to ask if is this experience shared among other DSs?\n\n",

I just finished my Masters in Data Science and the job search is brutal. The entry-level tech market is a bloodbath. Getting ghosted left and right.\n\nSo I'm thinking of saying screw it and trying my luck in finance. I've got the hard stats and Python skills, but my finance knowledge is basically zero. I know I'm not a finance bro, but can I even get a foot in the door?\n\nI need the straight truth. No sugar-coating.\n\nFrom what I've scraped together, here's the deal. Tell me if I'm on the right track or completely delusional.\n\nThe Gap I Need to Fill:\n\n· Finance 101: I need to learn the basics—like, what even is a DCF? Corporate finance, how markets work, all that jargon.\n· Applying my skills: How to use my Python/ML skills on financial data. Time series, forecasting, all that good stuff.\n· The hard stuff: The scary math that proper quants use.\n\nCerts? Worth it or a waste of time?\n\n· CFA: Looks like a hellish 3-level marathon. Is this a must-have to get past HR?\n· FRM: Seems more focused on risk. Maybe a faster option?\n· FMVA: Heard it's good for the practical, Excel-modeling side of things.\n\nMy real questions:\n\n· Is my Data Science degree actually a plus, or will they just toss my resume for not having \"Finance\" on it?\n· Am I just jumping from one sinking ship to another? Is finance any better right now?\n· Should I just grind out a few killer finance projects (like building a trading bot or a risk model) to prove I'm not clueless?\n\nI'm ready to put in the work. I just need to know if this is a viable path or if I'm setting myself up for another year of disappointment. What's the fastest way to stop being unemployed?\n",

      "title": "My Data Science Manifesto from a Self Taught Data Scientist",
      "selftext": "**Background**\n\nI’m a self-taught data scientist, with about 5 years of data analyst experience and now about 5 years as a Data Scientist. I’m more math minded than the average person, but I’m not special. I have a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, and have worked alongside 6 data scientists, 4 of which have PHDs and the other 2 have a masters. Despite being probably, the 6th out of 7 in natural ability, I have been the 2nd most productive data scientist out of the group.\n\n\n**Gatekeeping**\n\nEvery day someone on this subreddit asks some derivative of “what do I need to know to get started in ML/DS?” The answers are always smug and give some insane list of courses and topics one must master. As someone who’s been on both sides, this is attitude extremely annoying and rampart in the industry. I don’t think you can be bad at math and have no pre-requisite knowledge, and be successful, but the levels needed are greatly exaggerated. Most of the people telling you these things are just posturing due to insecurity.\n\n\n\nAs a mechanical engineering student, I had at least 3 calculus courses, a linear algebra course, and a probability course, but it was 10+ years before I attempted to become a DS, and I didn’t remember much at all. This sub, and others like it, made me think I had to be an expert in all these topics and many more to even think about trying to become a data scientist. \n\n\n\nWhen I started my journey, I would take coding, calculus, stats, linear algebra, etc. courses. I’d take a course, do OK in it, and move onto the next thing. However, eventually I’d get defeated because I realized I couldn’t remember much from the courses I took 3 months prior. It just felt like too much information for me to hold at a single time while working a full-time job. I never got started on actually solving problems because the internet and industry told me I needed to be an expert in all these things.\n\n\n**What you actually need**\n\nThe reality is, 95% of the time you only need a basic understanding of these topics. Projects often require a deeper dive into something else, but that's a case by case basis, and you figure that out as you go.\n\n\nFor calculus, you don't need to know how to integrate multivariable functions by hand. You need to know that derivatives create a function that represents the slope of the original function, and that where the derivative = 0 is a local min/max. You need to know integrals are area under the curve.\n\n\n\nFor stats, you need to understand what a p value represents. You don't need to know all the different tests, and when to use them. You need to know that they exist and why you need them. When it's time to use one, just google it, and figure out which one best suits your use case.\n\n\n\nFor linear algebra, you don't need to know how to solve for eigenvectors by hand, or whatever other specific things you do in that class. You need to know how to ‘read’ it. It is also helpful to know properties of linear algebra. Like the cross product of 2 vectors yields a vector perpendicular to both.\n\n\n\nFor probability, you need to understand basic things, but again, just google your specific problem.\n\n\n\nYou don't need to be an expert software dev. You need to write ok code, and be able to use chatGPT to help you improve it little by little.\n\n\n\nYou don't need to know how to build all the algorithms by hand. A general understanding of how they work is enough in 95% of cases.\n\n\n\nOf all of those things, the only thing you absolutely NEED to get started is basic coding ability. \n\n\n\nBy far the number one technical ability needed to 'master' is understanding how to \"frame\" your problem, and how to test and evaluate and interpret performance. If you can ensure that you're accurately framing the problem and evaluating the model or alogithm, with metrics that correctly align with the use case, that's enough to start providing some real value. I often see people asking things like \"should I do this feature engineering technique for this problem?\" or “which of these algorithms will perform best?”. The answer should usually be, \"I don't know, try it, measure it, and see\". Understanding how the algorithms work can give you clues into what you should try, but at the end of the day, you should just try it and see.   \n\n\n\nDespite the posturing in the industry, very few people are actually experts in all these domains. Some people are better at talking the talk than others, but at the end of the day, you WILL have to constantly research and learn on a project by project basis. That’s what makes it fun and interesting. As you gain PRACTICAL experience, you will grow, you will learn, you will improve beyond what you could've ever imagined. Just get the basics down and get started, don't spin your wheels trying and failing to nail all these disciplines before ever applying anything.\n\n\n\nThe reason I’m near the top in productivity while being near the bottom in natural and technical ability is my 5 years of experience as a data analyst at my company. During this time, I got really good at exploring my companies’ data. When you are stumped on problem, intelligently visualizing the data often reveals the solution. I’ve also had the luxury of analyzing our data from all different perspectives. I’d have assignments from marketing, product, tech support, customer service, software, firmware, and other technical teams. I understand the complete company better than the other data scientists. I’m also just aware of more ‘tips and tricks’ than anyone else.  \n\n\n\nGood domain knowledge and data exploration skills with average technical skills will outperform good technical skills with average domain knowledge and data exploration almost every time. \n\n\n**Advice for those self taught**\n\n\nI’ve been on the hiring side of things a few times now, and the market is certainly difficult. I think it would be very difficult for someone to online course and side project themselves directly into a DS job. The side project would have to be EXTREMELY impressive to be considered. However, I think my path is repeatable.\n\n\n\nI taught myself basic SQL and Tableau and completed a few side projects. I accepted a job as a data analyst, in a medium sized (100-200 total employees) on a team where DS and DA shared the same boss. The barrier to DA is likely higher than it was ~10 years ago, but it's definitely something achievable. My advice would be to find roles that you have some sort of unique experience with, and tailor your resume to that connection. No connection is too small. For example, my DA role required working with a lot of accelerometer data. In my previous job as a test engineer, I sometimes helped set up accelerometers to record data from the tests. This experience barely helped me at all when actually on the job, but it helped my resume actually get looked at. For entry level jobs employers are looking for ANY connection, because most entry level resumes all look the same.\n\n\nThe first year or two I excelled at my role as a DA. I made my boss aware that I wanted to become a DS eventually. He started to make me a small part of some DS projects, running queries, building dashboards to track performance and things like that. I was also a part of some of the meetings, so I got some insight into how certain problems were approached. \n\n\n\nMy boss made me aware that I would need to teach myself to code and machine learning. My role in the data science projects grew over time, but I was ultimately blocked from becoming a DS because I kept trying and failing to learn to code and the 25 areas of expertise reddit tells you that you need by taking MOOCs. \n\n  \n\nEventually, I paid up for DataQuest. I naively thought the course would teach me everything I needed to know. While you will not be proficient in anything DS upon completing, the interactive format made it easy to jump into 30-60 minutes of structured coding every day. Like a real language consistency is vital. \n\n\n\nOnce I got to the point where I could do some basic coding, I began my own side project. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. ONCE YOU GET THE BASELINE KNOWLEDGE, JUST GET STARTED WORKING ON THINGS. This is where the real learning began. You'll screw things up, and that's ok. Titanic problem is fine for day 1, but you really need a project of your own. I picked a project that I was interested in and had a function that I would personally use (I'm on V3 of this project and it's grown to a level that I never could've dreamed of at the time). This was crucial in ensuring that I stuck with the project, and had real investment in doing it correctly. When I didn’t know how to do something in the project, I would research it and figure it out. This is how it works in the real world.\n\n\n\nAfter 3 months of Dataquest and another 3 of a project (along with 4 years of being a data analyst) I convinced my boss to assign me DS project. I worked alongside another data scientist, but I owned the project, and they were mostly there for guidance, and coded some of the more complex things. I excelled at that project, and was promoted to data scientist, and began getting projects of my own, with less and less oversight. We have a very collaborative work environment, and the data scientists are truly out to help each other. We present our progress to each other often which allows us all to learn and improve. I have been promoted twice since I began DS work.\n\n\n\nI'd like to add that you can almost certainly do all this in less time than it took me. I wasted a lot of time spinning my wheels. ChatGPT is also a great resource that could also increase your learning speed. Don't blindly use it, but it's a great resource.\n\n\n**Tldr:** Sir this is Wendy’s.\n\n**Edit:** I’m not saying to never go deeper into things, I’m literally always learning. I go deeper into things all the time. Often in very niche domains, but you don't need to be a master in all things get started or even excel. Be able to understand generalities of those domains, and dig deeper when the problem calls for it. Learning a concept when you have a direct application is much more likely to stick.\n\n\nI thought it went without saying, but I’m not saying those things I listed are literally the only things you need to know about those topics, I was just giving examples of where relatively simple concepts were way more important than specifics.\n\n**Edit #2:** I'm not saying schooling is bad. Yes obviously having a masters and/or PhD is better than not. I'm directing this to those who are working a full time job who want to break into the field, but taking years getting a masters while working full time and going another 50K into debt is unrealistic",

      "title": "I did my Data Science final project on Romance Books! (I got a 102 🥳)",
      "selftext": "This was my very first Data Science class I'm doing for my Statistics degree. We work in RStudio to create and analyze data, and for the final project (worth 25% of my grade... 💀) We were assigned to find or create a \\*\\*big ass\\*\\* dataset, and then ask and answer questions about it using graphs.\n\nI decided I wanted to torture myself and create my own dataset using my TBR list, which exists entirely on [Romance.io](http://Romance.io) so THANK YOU to that website for existing!!\n\n\n\n[This is the \\\\\"glimpse\\\\\" at my data I was required to include](https://preview.redd.it/0zrcv77iwc6e1.png?width=1794&format=png&auto=webp&s=444e7cacd2250cff3997955d9bdd168c7130518c)\n\n  \nYeah, I'm pretty sure I \\*definitely\\* got points for being the only one in the class to figure out how to customize my colors and fonts 💕\n\n\n\n[This was my bubble chart that I was way too proud of cause this took FOREVER 💀](https://preview.redd.it/lspkmxhwwc6e1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=98222c59ae188dc3d9fa86e573193c89a654c060)\n\n  \nI am skipping through a lot of these slides cause its like a 20 minute presentation, I just thought I'd show y'all all the \\*cool\\* graphs...  \n\n\n[Ngl, I literally just copy\\/pasted a unicode character into the code to get this effect... 💀💅](https://preview.redd.it/f5viyv17xc6e1.png?width=1590&format=png&auto=webp&s=942e357ae92bfddc48a6ff50ada54d8638b1d43a)\n\n  \nOh yeah, and btw, I \\*did\\* indeed compile every possible tag the amount of times it was tagged for all 1652 books in my TBR, and thats why the numbers are so high. Also yes, that absurdly high one at the top \\*is\\* Fourth Wing 💀\n\n\n\nI used an excel sheet to compile the data, which ended up having 350 columns and 1666 rows worth of hand inputed data 🙃 (i'm not tired at all) \n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p1oggz1sxc6e1.png?width=1590&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f33062234e7785b23aa5c550414f2030216ad1b\n\n  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xtnss9lxxc6e1.png?width=1590&format=png&auto=webp&s=c72a857f266f6b12abed1e546975ad6441a34fb2\n\n\n\nDuring the \"audience participation\" portion of the presentation we all stayed on these two graphs for like a solid 5 minutes bc everyone thought it was both hilarious and sad. Most of the class was indeed men, and like 5 of them did their presentation on different variations of sports data. So looking at this, it kinda put into perspective the different types of labels men and women are automatically assigned to. Which is sad. But also, kinda fucking hilarious that the only people allowed to be Take-Charge Criminals are women. 🤣🤣\n\n\n\n[This was my piece de resistance for showcasing my personal tastes, remember this is My TBR list, so judge me all you want, I deserve it. 💀✌️](https://preview.redd.it/ipqbuv9vyc6e1.png?width=1590&format=png&auto=webp&s=05ed635da7af7277baf1559943daeda8e8aadac0)\n\n  \nI had a few other graphs that I didn't want to include cause this is a super long post already. I just thought y'all might appreciate this. Some other fun little tidbits is that I had a world map and us heat map, which told me that Illinois is a weirdly popular state for setting.. Also the timeline of the books I had read so far and the demographics breakdown of the characters.\n\n  \nI had SO much fun making this, and I gotta give props to my amazing professor. I probably definitely got some extra points cause she's definitely the biggest romance lover in that class, and I didn't even know that until I had already started the project. One of her only note for me was that I should use less emojis out in the real world... Not pictured: The emojis I put in every slide's title.. 💀\n\n  \nIf you might wanna see some of the other graphs I made, the whole uncropped slides, or hell, even the code I used, let me know! I hoped y'all enjoyed this silly little ride! 😋💕",

What we’re seeing now is a shift from deep statistical analysis and business oriented modeling to quick and dirty engineering solutions. Sure, this approach might give us a few immediate wins but it leads to low ROI projects and pulls the field further away from its true potential. One size-fits-all programming just doesn’t work. it’s not the whole game.\n",
