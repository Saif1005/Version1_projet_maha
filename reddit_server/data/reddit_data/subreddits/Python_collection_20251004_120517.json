Currently, a module is eagerly loaded at the point of the import statement. Lazy imports defer the loading and execution of a module until the first time the imported name is used.\n\nBy allowing developers to mark individual imports as lazy with explicit syntax, Python programs can reduce startup time, memory usage, and unnecessary work. This is particularly beneficial for command-line tools, test suites, and applications with large dependency graphs.\n\nThe proposal preserves full backwards compatibility: normal import statements remain unchanged, and lazy imports are enabled only where explicitly requested.",

      "selftext": "**What My Project Does**  \nI built a small Clue/Cluedo-style deduction game in **Python** using **pygame**. It’s a scene-based desktop game with clean, portable asset handling. You can run it from source or as a single **Windows .exe** (PyInstaller one-file). The repo is meant to be a practical reference for packaging pygame apps reliably.\n\n**Source code (GitHub):**  \n[https://github.com/rozsit/112\\_PyClue\\_Game](https://github.com/rozsit/112_PyClue_Game)\n\n*(Windows build is in the GitHub Release — see “Downloads” below.)*\n\n**Target Audience**\n\n* Python devs interested in **pygame** architecture and **packaging to .exe**.\n* Learners who want a small, readable codebase (scenes, UI, audio, animations).\n* Casual players who just want to double-click an `.exe` and try a Clue-like game.\n\n**Comparison**  \nCompared with other “pygame Clue clones” or small hobby games, this repo focuses on **robust distribution** and **developer ergonomics**:\n\n* Works the same in **dev** and **frozen** modes (PyInstaller).\n* Global hooks route string paths for `pygame.image.load`, `pygame.mixer.Sound`, and `pygame.mixer.music.load` → fewer path bugs after packaging.\n* **Audio init** on Windows is hardened (`ensure_audio()` tries multiple drivers/buffer sizes).\n* **Animated GIF** support via **Pillow** (e.g., winner screen fireworks → frames + per-frame duration).\n* Comes with a one-command **build script** (PowerShell) and a **SHA-256** file for integrity checks.\n\n**How Python Is Used**\n\n* **pygame** for windowing, scenes, input, and rendering.\n* **Pillow** to decode animated GIFs into (surface, duration) frames.\n* **PyInstaller** (one-file) to ship a single `.exe`.\n\n**Minimal snippets (the core ideas):**\n\n    # resource_path: dev + PyInstaller (_MEIPASS) friendly\n    from pathlib import Path\n    import sys\n    def resource_path(*parts):\n        if hasattr(sys, \"_MEIPASS\"):\n            base = Path(sys._MEIPASS)\n        else:\n            here = Path(__file__).resolve()\n            base = next((p for p in [here] + list(here.parents) if (p / \"assets\").exists()), here)\n        return str((base / Path(*parts)).resolve())\n    \n\n    # global hooks so string paths work after packaging, too\n    import pygame\n    _orig_img = pygame.image.load\n    def _img_wrapped(path, *a, **kw):\n        from utils import resource_path\n        if isinstance(path, str): path = resource_path(path)\n        return _orig_img(path, *a, **kw)\n    pygame.image.load = _img_wrapped\n    \n    # similar tiny wrappers exist for pygame.mixer.Sound and pygame.mixer.music.load\n    \n\n**Run from Source**\n\n    git clone https://github.com/rozsit/112_PyClue_Game\n    cd 112_PyClue_Game\n    python -m venv .venv\n    .\\.venv\\Scripts\\activate           # Windows\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n    python main.py\n    \n\n**Downloads (Windows .exe)**  \nGrab the one-file build from the Release page:  \n[https://github.com/rozsit/112\\_PyClue\\_Game/releases/tag/v1.0.0](https://github.com/rozsit/112_PyClue_Game/releases/tag/v1.0.0)\n\n**(Optional) Verify SHA-256 on Windows**\n\n    Get-FileHash .\\PyClue.exe -Algorithm SHA256\n    # or\n    certutil -hashfile .\\PyClue.exe SHA256\n    \n\nThe output should match the `PyClue.exe.sha256` provided in the release.\n\n**Roadmap / PRs Welcome**\n\n* New boards, items, rule variants\n* Simple AI opponents\n* Local/online multiplayer\n* Localization (EN/HU)\n* Save/load & stats\n\nI’d love feedback on packaging tricks (PyInstaller + pygame), audio reliability on different Windows setups, and ergonomics of the scene/asset layout.",
